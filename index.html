                <span class="dateline">BOTHELL, Wash.</span> — As North Creek High School prepares for the upcoming academic year, a debate over parking pass distribution has ignited frustration among students — and uncertainty over whether seniors will get priority.
            </p>

            <p>
                In a group chat among rising seniors, the discussion quickly turned from logistical planning to policy confusion. According to Aman Kolli, a rising senior at North Creek High School, the school's approach to parking passes may not give upperclassmen the advantage they expect.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "No more groups for parking pass, first come first serve," Kolli wrote in the chat. "Spots are allocated by the form. So if 100 seniors filled out the form, the first 100 spots can only be taken by seniors — I think. That's what they did last year… Don't quote me, not sure."
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The conversation included Ibrahim Ansari, also a rising senior, who responded enthusiastically to the idea of arriving early: "F** yeah, I'm showing up at 8:30."
            </p>

            <p>
                But Ronak Singh, another rising senior, pointed out a flaw in the system. "Ibrahim, we get there at 8," Singh said, before realizing the implications. "Wait bruh, this is messed up. Sophomores can get passes before us — it's just based on first come first serve."
            </p>

            <p>
                The parking pass system at North Creek High has historically been a contentious topic. While official school communications about the allocation process have yet to be released, the student chatter underscores the high stakes — and high stress — surrounding what is, for many, a key part of their daily routine.
            </p>

            <p>
                For seniors who see driving and parking on campus as a milestone of independence, the possibility of losing out to younger students has only fueled the urgency to arrive early and claim a spot. Whether the policy will ultimately match last year's approach remains to be seen.
